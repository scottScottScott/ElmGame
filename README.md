# ElmGame

A game I made in Elm for my Functional Languages Class. 

The game can be played by running Manatee.html. <br /> 
Use the arrow keys to play: up to accelerate, right and left to rotate. <br />
Try to jump as high as possible by using speed and landing cleanly from jumps. <br />

A link - which should work - to a webpage that runs - sorta wonky - Manatee.html:
