# ElmGame

A game I made in Elm for my Functional Languages Class.

The game can be played by running Manatee.html.
Use the arrow keys to play: up to accelerate, right and left to rotate.
Try to jump as high as possible by landing cleanly from jumps.

A link - which should work - to a webpage that runs - sorta wonky - Manatee.html:
